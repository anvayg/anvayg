#### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former academic looking to transition to a full-time role in industry. Some projects that I'm currently or have recently worked on:

- A [bytecode compiler](https://github.com/anvayg/bytecode-compiler) for Lisp written in C++
- [sarah-connor](https://github.com/cceckman/sarah-connor): A termination checker for LLVM IR programs
- [single-file-devin](https://github.com/stefanlance/single_file_devin): An LLM-powered software engineering agent for single-file Python programs.

I've also worked on a few different research projects in the areas of Programming Languages, Compilers, and Formal Methods during my time in college and grad school:

-  I wrote a Continuation-Passing Style transformation for the [CertiCoq compiler](https://github.com/certiCoq/certicoq/)
   and helped proved its [semantic correctness](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kR6ogecAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kR6ogecAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C). 
 - I developed and implemented an algorithm for synthesizing (automatically generating) [transducers from formal specifications](https://github.com/anvayg/transducer-repair) using SMT solvers. This project was published as a [paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kR6ogecAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kR6ogecAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC).
 - Most recently, I was working on a technique for synthesizing formal semantics of languages using language interpreters as oracles. I have also worked on projects in automated program verification and have experience applying formal methods in industry.
