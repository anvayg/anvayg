#### Hi 👋

I'm a former academic looking to transition to a full-time role in industry. Some projects that I'm currently or have recently worked on:

- A [bytecode compiler](https://github.com/anvayg/bytecode-compiler) for Lisp written in C++
- [sarah-connor](https://github.com/cceckman/sarah-connor): A termination checker for LLVM IR programs
- [single-file-devin](https://github.com/stefanlance/single_file_devin): An LLM-powered software engineering agent for single-file Python programs.

I've also worked on a few different research projects in the areas of Programming Languages, Compilers, and Formal Methods during my time in college and grad school:

-  I wrote a Continuation-Passing Style transformation for the [CertiCoq compiler](https://github.com/certiCoq/certicoq/)
   and helped proved its [semantic correctness](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kR6ogecAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kR6ogecAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C). 
 - I developed and implemented an algorithm for synthesizing (automatically generating) string-manipulating programs modeled as [transducers from formal specifications](https://github.com/anvayg/transducer-repair) using an SMT solver. This project was published as a [paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kR6ogecAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kR6ogecAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC).
 - Most recently, I was working on a technique for synthesizing formal semantics of languages using language interpreters as oracles. I have also worked on projects in automated program verification and have experience applying formal methods in industry.

A few miscellaneous programming projects:

- [models-from-scratch](https://github.com/anvayg/models-from-scratch): Implementations of logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors in Python.
- [tcp-flow-control](https://github.com/anvayg/tcp-flow-control): An implementation of the flow control algorithm used for TCP using the socket library in Python.
- [recursion-schemes-synthesis](https://github.com/anvayg/recursion-schemes-synthesis): A toy project exploring program synthesis using catamorphisms.
